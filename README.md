# Lego Ev3 communictations library

Dotnet core - Netstandard 2.0 F# API to interact with a Lego mindstorms EV3 brick (https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms)

Started as a port of Brian Peeks C# implementation (https://github.com/BrianPeek/legoev3). But implementation has diverged quite a bit. Still heavily inspired by Brians work.



Work very much in progress
